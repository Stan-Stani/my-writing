Yesterday I had a great evening. I went to a speed-friending event locally here in
Fargo at Parachigo. I went a few months back and recall having an okay time, but last night I experienced joy for the first time in a while. I need to experience joy more often. I had basically forgotten what it was like, and now that I've been reminded, I realize it's a missing essential component of a life worth living.

I almost went out again to Parachigo tonight, but paradoxically I have been feeling the need to stay in and engage in some of my hobbies.
