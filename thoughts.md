Yesterday I had a great evening. I went to a speed-friending event locally here in
Fargo at Parachigo. I went a few months back and recall having an okay time, but last night I experienced joy for the first time in a while. I need to experience joy more often. I had basically forgotten what it was like, and now that I've been reminded, I realize it's a missing essential component of a life worth living.

I almost went out again to Parachigo tonight, but paradoxically I have been feeling the need to stay in and engage in some of my hobbies.

I was very close to buying the game "Sifu" on Friday evening, even though I wanted myself to go to Y2Klub. What calmed we down was taking Maisie for a second walk and thus just being present and embodied in the world. I think I spend enough time in my own head, like at work, and a way to reground myself is to go move through the world, as a physical being. Staying at home allows me to be too much in my head as I'm too familiar with my surroundings and they aren't changing because I'm not moving through the world. 

You see, I don't really get Sunday-scaries anymore, because I love my job and it's low stress. But I do get Friday-scaries. I come home from work and part of me really just wants to escape into a video game. But I know if I do I will be hard pressed to stop playing come bedtime, and/or I'll spend money I really need to save. And then I probably won't even keep playing the game because I'll eventually come to my senses over the weekend and try to swear off playing games in the evening again.

Anyway, I ended up reading more of "The Diamond Age, or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer" and then got myself to head to Parachigo for Y2Klub at about 9:30 p.m. I ended up staying through closing, and I had a really good time, largely because I got to socialize with people I found interesting, but also just because I got to dance to a few actual Vocaloid songs out in the world!
